# DATA_STRUCTURE_JAVA
This repository contains Java implementations of a basic singly linked list data structure. Linked lists are fundamental data structures used to store and manage collections of elements, providing dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.

### Features

- **Singly Linked List**: The repository includes the implementation of a singly linked list, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the list.

- **Basic Operations**: The linked list supports common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

- **Generic**: The linked list is implemented in a generic manner, allowing you to use it with different data types.

### How to Use

To use the linked list in your Java projects, you can clone this repository or download the linked list class and include it in your project. Once you have the class available, you can create a new instance of the `LinkedList` class and start using the provided methods to manage the list.
